The Strong Towns movement advocates for sustainable urban development by promoting financially resilient and adaptable communities. It emphasizes prioritizing small-scale, incremental growth over large-scale projects that can strain municipal budgets. Originating in the United States, it urges cities to focus on traditional development patterns, walkability, and local economies to build stronger, more resilient towns. Strong Towns encourages citizen engagement, bottom-up planning, and infrastructure investments that generate long-term returns. Its principles aim to create communities that are economically vibrant, socially inclusive, and environmentally sustainable, fostering a more resilient foundation for future generations.

The Strong Towns movement fundamentally challenges the conventional approach to urban planning and development, which often prioritizes large-scale projects and expansion at the expense of long-term financial stability and community resilience. Strong Towns advocates for a shift towards a more sustainable model of development, one that focuses on building financially strong and adaptable towns through incremental growth and investment in existing infrastructure.

This movement emphasizes the importance of traditional development patterns, such as mixed land uses, compact neighborhoods, and pedestrian-friendly streets, which can create vibrant and economically diverse communities. By prioritizing these principles, Strong Towns aims to create places where people can live, work, and thrive while minimizing the financial burden on local governments and fostering a sense of belonging and community ownership.

Furthermore, Strong Towns encourages citizen engagement in the planning and decision-making processes, believing that local knowledge and participation are essential for creating successful and resilient communities. By empowering residents to take an active role in shaping the future of their towns, the movement seeks to create places that are not only financially resilient but also socially inclusive and environmentally sustainable.
